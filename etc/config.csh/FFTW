#
# Description
#     Setup file for FFTW include/libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/cshrc
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following settings:
#
#         fftw_version=fftw-system
#
#     If the system fftw is unusable (eg, too old) and you don't
#     have or want a ThirdParty installation:
#
#         fftw_version=fftw-none
#
#     If using a central installation, but not located under ThirdParty:
#         - specify fftw-system
#         - provide full paths for FFTW_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When building OpenFOAM, any changes made here MUST be made in the
#     equivalent config.sh version too, since that is the one which will
#     be used during the build process.

# outside of ThirdParty and must be added to the lib-path.
