# File
#     etc/config.sh/CGAL
#
# Description
#     Setup file for CGAL (& boost) include/libraries.
#     Sourced from OpenFOAM-<VERSION>/etc/bashrc
#
#     If using system-wide installations, use the following settings:
#
#         boost_version=boost-system
#         cgal_version=cgal-system
#
#     If the system boost/cgal is unusable (eg, too old) and you don't
#     have or want a ThirdParty installation:
#
#         boost_version=boost-none
#         cgal_version=cgal-none
#
#     If using a central installation, but not located under ThirdParty:
#         - specify boost-system / cgal-system
#         - provide full paths for BOOST_ARCH_PATH / CGAL_ARCH_PATH
#
# Note
#     When _foamAddLib is unset (eg, called from makeCGAL):
#         - boost_version / cgal_version variables are retained.
#         - the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not adjusted.
